The classical introductory exercise. Just say "Hello, World!".

"Hello, World!" is the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language or environment.

The objectives are simple:

    Write a function that returns the string "Hello, World!".
    Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.
    Submit your solution and check it at the website.

If everything goes well, you will be ready to fetch your first real exercise.
Getting Started

Make sure you have read the C page on the Exercism site. This covers the basic information on setting up the development environment expected by the exercises.
Passing the Tests

Get the first test compiling, linking and passing by following the three rules of test-driven development.

The included makefile can be used to create and run the tests using the test task.

make test

Create just the functions you need to satisfy any compiler errors and get the test to fail. Then write just enough code to get the test to pass. Once you've done that, move onto the next test.

As you progress through the tests, take the time to refactor your implementation for readability and expressiveness and then go on to the next test.

Try to use standard C99 facilities in preference to writing your own low-level algorithms or facilities by hand.
